# Introduction
This project is an interactive audio visualizer built with React and Vite. It renders real-time visualizations of audio input on a canvas, designed for performance, responsiveness, and easy customization. The codebase emphasizes modularity, with separate components for the canvas visualization, controls panel, theme handling, and transport bar, allowing developers to extend features such as additional visual styles, input sources, and export options.

Key goals:
- Provide a visually engaging, real-time representation of audio data.
- Offer a lightweight, extensible architecture suitable for experimentation and customization.
- Include practical UI components (controls, theme picker, and transport) to manage playback and visuals.
- Facilitate local development and quick iteration with a straightforward run locally workflow.

What youâ€™ll find in this repo:
- A React + Vite setup for a performant single-page app.
- Canvas-based visualizer core (CanvasVisualizer.tsx) and supporting UI components.
- Hooks for audio engine and recording capabilities.
- Utilities for colors, beat detection, and exporting visuals.
- A preview set of visual frames and a minimal CSS baseline.

How to get started:
- Install dependencies: npm install
- Run locally: npm run dev
